# AI Looting Script Roadmap
## ASAP
- Calculate vehicle used cargo to determine if new weapon can be added
- Figure out how to pull all items from vehicle cargo
- Function to summate all item weights and return number
## Fast follow
- Decide method to store current/last leader vehicle so AI can drop off loot
- Make edits to take advantage of the above
- Standardize function names
## Future
- Units can loot all items from bodies
- Script options to limit what gets looted
- Looting AI can onlly store up to his extra load from clothing??
- If the above, multi-trip looting
- Higher-level scope to work with multiple units via faux wqueue and working paradigm
- Refactor functions to separate scripts and set up functions library
- Looting from other sources? I.e cars
- AI just holds loot if player vehicle gets destroyed or never got in one??
